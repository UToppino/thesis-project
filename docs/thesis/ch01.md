# Chapter 1: CNN + MLP on normalized dataset

## Description of the dataset

## Description of the model structure
### Conv layers for feature extraction
### MLP layers for classification
#### Calculations for estimating the correct number of neurons

## Description of the training process
### Training parameters
### Hyperparameter search

## Results
### My results
### Comparison with previous results by Sensichips

## Notes
### Problems with dataset
#### Cut heartbeats are not realistic
#### Normalization is not constant between different beats
#### The way beats are cut could be better
